The time complexity of the Recursive Alternating Strings is O(n) and n would be equal to the length of the string.
The space complexity of the Recursive Alternating Strings in also O(n) because the space needed for the input would be equal to
the number of times the function is recursively called, which would always equal to the length of the string.

The time complexity of Staircase is O(n^2) because there are three for-loops with two of them nested within the first for loop.
This is also equal to the sum of the total iterations for the inner loop multiplied by the iterations of the outer loop.
The space complexity of Staircase is O(1) because there is no recursion or need for an increased space which means that the input n, will always be constant.
